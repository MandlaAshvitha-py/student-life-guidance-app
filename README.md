# Student Life Guidance & Exam Alert App

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered student guidance application designed
to act like a human mentor throughout a student's academic life.

The platform supports students from post-10th level to degree holders
and government job aspirants by providing guidance, alerts, and updates
related to education, exams, scholarships, and jobs.

---

## Problem Statement
Students often miss opportunities because:
- Information is scattered across many websites
- They don’t know what exams or paths suit them
- They forget exam dates, applications, and results
- Poor and rural students lack proper guidance

---

## Proposed Solution
A single intelligent application that:
- Understands the student's education level
- Asks what the student is looking for
- Suggests suitable exams, courses, and career paths
- Provides explanations in simple language
- Includes an in-app AI chatbot for doubt clarification
- Sends automatic alerts for:
  - Exam dates
  - Admit cards
  - Results
  - Government job notifications
  - New education-related updates

The app also informs users about new competitive exams, government posts,
job applications, and scholarships even if the user did not explicitly search.

---

## Key Features
- Education-stage-based personalized guidance
- Human-like AI chatbot inside the app
- Smart suggestions instead of raw exam lists
- WhatsApp-style notification alerts
- Application status tracking
- Continuous updates on education and job opportunities

---

## Application Flow (MVP)
1. User selects current education level
2. App asks what the user is looking for
3. App provides smart, filtered suggestions
4. User interacts with chatbot for doubts
5. Official links provided for applications
6. App sends reminders and alerts automatically

---

## MVP Scope
The first version (MVP) will focus on students who completed 10th class.
The same logic will later be extended to intermediate, degree,
and government job aspirants.

---

## Vision
To build a lifelong digital mentor that supports students from school
education to employment by ensuring they never miss an opportunity.
